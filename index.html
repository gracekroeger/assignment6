			<h2>About this app</h2>
			<p>Include information here about your app.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Instructions for using the app</b></li>
				<p> Press V to navigate from bottom to top by column. Press B to navigate from left to right by row. Press H to click (note: I was unable to make this fuction work)
				<li><b>Test results</b></li>
				<p> 5 trials were conducted with the following equations: <br><br>
				1. 58*24 <br>
				2. 69/13 <br>
				3. 15+36 <br>
				4. 12-32 <br>
				5. 74*35 <br><br>
				and were tested with two conditions: pressing the keys by hand/fingers and pressing the keys through foot/toes. Although the clicking function did not work, the trial was conducted based off of if it did have functionality. Using fingers had an average speed of 28.39 seconds and 2 errors, while toes had an average speed of 47.2 and 3 errors. I noticied that the condition of navigating through the calculator with toes on your foots was more difficult as the toes are signifigantly larger then fingers, so it becomes easier to hit an unintended button. In addition, when using fingers to navigate, you are able to rest each finger individually on a button allowing the user to minimally move. When navigating with toes you have to move your foot slightly to align with the button you intend to press. 
				<li><b>Anything else you have tried out</b></li>
				<p> I could have tried out changing the placement of the keys to see which locations were the most inuitive for the user.
